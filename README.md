# odin-recipes

This project is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It focuses on practicing fundamental HTML skills to structure a multi-page website.

## Project Description

The website consists of a main index page that links to several recipe pages. Each recipe page will contain:

* The name of the recipe.
* An image of the finished dish.
* A description of the recipe.
* A list of ingredients.
* Step-by-step instructions for making the dish.

This project emphasizes the structural aspect of web development using HTML. While the website will not be styled with CSS at this stage, it lays the foundation for future styling and enhancements.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:

* Set up a basic HTML project structure with an `index.html` file.
* Create and link multiple HTML pages within a project.
* Use boilerplate HTML in all HTML files.
* Implement headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`).
* Create text paragraphs (`p`).
* Add images (`img`).
* Create unordered lists (`ul`, `li`) for ingredients.
* Create ordered lists (`ol`, `li`) for recipe steps.
* Implement hyperlinks (`a href`) for navigation between pages.
* Organize project files into directories.
* Set up and use a GitHub repository for version control.
* Write meaningful Git commit messages.
* Publish a basic website using GitHub Pages.
