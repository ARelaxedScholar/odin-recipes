		<h1>The Beaver Tail with No Meat</h1>
		<p>As a kid, when I heard of beaver tail for the first time, I was both confused and excited. Isn't a beaver tail really hard (considering beavers use it as a hammer for building) and isn't the beaver the Canadian emblem (like they're fine eating it?), so when my dad told me we'd go to try some, I was hyped as all heck. Until, I got there and saw the skors and Oreo flavors. And got to taste a crunchy and sweet fried pastry.</p>

		<p>Beaver tail tastes great, don't get me wrong. In fact, I want to eat one right now. But to this day, some part of me, is kinda peeved at the deception.</p>

		<p>Rambling aside, here is the recipe.</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
  <li>5 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
  <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
  <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
  <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>5 cups whole wheat flour</li>
  <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
  <li>Cinnamon Sugar:
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

	<ol>
  <li>Mix warm water, yeast, and a pinch of sugar; let sit until creamy (about 5 minutes).</li>
  <li>Grease a separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Stir warm milk, eggs, ⅓ cup oil, ⅓ cup sugar, salt, and vanilla into yeast mixture until sugar dissolves. Stir in 2 ½ cups flour until no dry spots.</li>
  <li>Knead in remaining flour until dough is no longer sticky. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes).</li>
  <li>Form dough into a ball, place in greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled (about 1 hour).</li>
  <li>Punch down dough and knead a few times to reshape.</li>
  <li>Pinch off egg-sized pieces of dough and roll into ¼-inch thick ovals. Place on a dish towel and cover.</li>
  <li>Heat 4 inches of oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Make cinnamon sugar: Combine sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish.</li>
  <li>Carefully lower dough into hot oil in batches and fry until golden brown (1 to 2 minutes per side).</li>
  <li>Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
  <li>Gently press warm fried dough into cinnamon sugar. Shake off excess.</li>
</ol></body>
